# ML Challenge - Group Project

## Overview
Hi! I am Yaqov. This project was part of the ML Challenge for Machine Learning course in a Data Science program at a university, completed in collaboration with a team of 4 students. 
The goal was to predict the year of publication of scientific papers based on their metadata, using machine learning techniques.
The task involved feature engineering, selection of learning algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and performance analysis. 
Our solution is based on the provided dataset, predicting the year of publication for a set of scientific papers.

## Code
The repository contains Python scripts used for generating predictions. It includes:

- `prediction_script.py`: The main script used to generate predictions.
- Additional Python modules (if any).

*Note: The code does not include test data due to their size. It is linked here - test set: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17D3pZRaTA2dl2wnXbNafm0ikPX8hu0Cb/view?usp=sharing*

## Dataset
The challenge utilized a dataset comprising metadata of scientific papers, divided into training and testing sets (`train.json` and `test.json`). The goal was to predict the publication year for papers in the test set.
The solution's performance was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. 

## Submission and Leaderboard
Our submission was ranked on a leaderboard based on MAE. Bonus points were awarded based on the leaderboard ranking. This project gained 9 out of 12 points, as the final error was decent - below average and the report was detailed.
